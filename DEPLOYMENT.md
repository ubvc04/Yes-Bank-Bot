   - Sign up with GitHub account
   - Connect your GitHub repositories

2. **Create New Service**

   ```
   Name: yes-bank-stock-alert
   Environment: Python 3
   Region: Oregon (US West) - or closest to you
   Instance Type: Free (sufficient for this app)

   ```

4. **Set Environment Variables**
   In the "Environment" section, add:
   ```
   EMAIL_ADDRESS = baveshchowdary1@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD = ilsp zgmj pfhj iyli
   ```

5. **Deploy**
   - Click "Create Background Worker"
   - Wait for deployment (usually 2-5 minutes)
   - Monitor logs for successful startup

### 3. Monitor Deployment

**View Logs:**
- Go to your service dashboard
- Click "Logs" tab
- Look for: "[OK] System started successfully. Monitoring in progress..."

**Expected Log Pattern:**
```
[START] Starting Stock Alert Automation System
Monitoring: YESBANK.NS
Threshold: Rs.17.99
Check interval: 60 seconds
Alert cooldown: 30.0 minutes
[OK] Configuration validation passed
[OK] Email service connection successful
[OK] Yahoo Finance connection successful
[OK] System started successfully. Monitoring in progress...
```

### 4. Verify System is Working

1. **Check Logs Every Few Minutes:**
   - Should see periodic price checks
   - No error messages in steady state

2. **Test Alert (Optional):**
   - Temporarily modify threshold in config.py to test alerts
   - Push changes to trigger re-deployment
   - Verify email alerts are received

### 5. Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **Build Failed:**
   - Check requirements.txt is valid
   - Ensure all files are committed to git

2. **Email Authentication Error:**
   - Verify environment variables are set correctly
   - Ensure no spaces in email password

3. **Stock Data Issues:**
   - System will use mock data if Yahoo Finance is unavailable
   - This is normal for testing/development

**Debug Commands (run locally):**
```bash
python main.py --test  # Test all components
python test_alert.py   # Test email alerts
```

### 6. Cost Information

**Render Free Tier:**
- 750 hours/month (enough for 24/7 operation)
- No bandwidth limits for this use case
- Perfect for this lightweight application

**Upgrade Options:**
- If you need more reliability: $7/month for Starter plan
- Includes persistent storage and priority support

### 7. Monitoring Your Deployment

**Daily Checks:**
1. Visit Render dashboard
2. Check service status (should be "Running")
3. Review recent logs for any errors
4. Verify email alerts are working if price drops

**Weekly Maintenance:**
1. Check for any system updates needed
2. Verify Yahoo Finance connection is stable
3. Review alert frequency and adjust if needed

2. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Update configuration"
   git push
   ```

**To Change Stock Symbol:**
1. Edit `config.py` ‚Üí Change `STOCK_SYMBOL`
2. Edit `README.md` ‚Üí Update documentation
3. Commit and push changes

### 9. Security Best Practices

‚úÖ **What's Already Done:**
- Email credentials stored as environment variables
- Private repository recommended
- Secure SMTP connection with TLS

‚ö†Ô∏è **Additional Recommendations:**
- Regularly rotate email app password
- Monitor logs for any suspicious activity
- Keep dependencies updated

### 10. Success Checklist

After deployment, verify:
- [ ] Service shows "Running" status in Render
