# 🚨 Enhanced Stock Alert System - FIXES IMPLEMENTED

## 🔧 **Problems Fixed**

### ❌ **Original Issues:**
1. **Sent alerts outside market hours** (e.g., at 11 PM)
2. **Used delayed/stale price data** from earlier in the day
3. **Repeated spam emails** even when price stayed below threshold

### ✅ **Solutions Implemented:**

---

## 🕘 **1. Market Hours Filtering**

**Implementation:**
- **NSE Trading Hours**: 09:15 AM - 03:30 PM IST (Monday-Friday)
- **Timezone Aware**: Uses `pytz` for accurate IST time handling
- **Weekend Detection**: No alerts on Saturday/Sunday

**How it Works:**
```python
# Market hours check in config.py
MARKET_TIMEZONE = pytz.timezone('Asia/Kolkata')
MARKET_OPEN_TIME = time(9, 15)   # 09:15 AM IST  
MARKET_CLOSE_TIME = time(15, 30) # 03:30 PM IST

@classmethod
def is_market_open(cls):
    ist_now = datetime.now(cls.MARKET_TIMEZONE)
    current_time = ist_now.time()
    current_weekday = ist_now.weekday()  # 0=Monday, 6=Sunday
    
    # Check weekday (Monday=0 to Friday=4)
    if current_weekday > 4:  # Weekend
        return False
    
    # Check time range
    return cls.MARKET_OPEN_TIME <= current_time <= cls.MARKET_CLOSE_TIME
```

**Result:**
- ✅ **No alerts sent at 11 PM or any time outside 09:15-15:30 IST**
- ✅ **No alerts on weekends**
- ✅ **Market status logging shows open/close times**

## 📊 **2. Real-Time Price Data**

**Implementation:**
- **During Market Hours**: Uses 1-minute interval data for real-time prices
- **Outside Market Hours**: Uses last trading day's closing price
- **Data Timestamp Logging**: Shows when price data is from

**How it Works:**
```python
def get_current_price(self):
    if self.is_market_open():
        # Real-time 1-minute data during market hours
        data = self.ticker.history(period="1d", interval="1m")
    else:
        # Last trading day data when market closed
        data = self.ticker.history(period="5d")
        self.logger.info("Market closed - using last trading day's closing price")
    
    current_price = float(data['Close'].iloc[-1])
    data_timestamp = data.index[-1].strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")
    
    market_status = "OPEN" if self.is_market_open() else "CLOSED"
    self.logger.info(f"[{market_status}] {self.stock_symbol} price: ₹{current_price:.2f} (data from: {data_timestamp})")
```

**Result:**
- ✅ **Fresh price data during market hours**
- ✅ **No stale evening prices used for morning alerts**
- ✅ **Clear logging of data freshness**

## 🔄 **3. Proper Rate Limiting**

**Implementation:**
- **State-Based Logic**: Tracks when price crosses threshold boundaries
- **Alert Per Crossing**: Only one alert per "below threshold period"
- **Reset on Recovery**: Alert capability resets when price goes above threshold

**How it Works:**
```python
class StockMonitor:
    def __init__(self, email_service):
        self.alert_sent = False  # Track if alert sent for current below-threshold period
        self.last_price_above_threshold = True  # Track price position relative to threshold
    
    def should_send_alert(self, current_price):
        # 1. Market must be open
        if not self.is_market_open():
            return False
        
        # 2. Price must be below threshold  
        if current_price >= self.threshold:
            # Price recovered - reset alert state
            if not self.last_price_above_threshold:
                self.alert_sent = False  # Ready for next alert
            self.last_price_above_threshold = True
            return False
        
        # 3. Haven't already alerted for this below-threshold period
        self.last_price_above_threshold = False
        if self.alert_sent:
            return False  # Already alerted
        
        return True  # All conditions met
```

**Alert Scenarios:**
```
Price Movement:    Alert Sent:
₹19.00 → ₹17.50   ✅ YES (first time below ₹18.00)
₹17.50 → ₹17.30   ❌ NO  (already alerted for this period)  
₹17.30 → ₹17.10   ❌ NO  (still same below-threshold period)
₹17.10 → ₹18.50   ❌ NO  (price recovered, alert state reset)
₹18.50 → ₹17.80   ✅ YES (new below-threshold period)
```

**Result:**
- ✅ **No spam emails when price stays below threshold**
- ✅ **Only one alert per threshold crossing**
- ✅ **Automatic reset when price recovers**

## 📧 **4. Enhanced Email Format**

**New Email Format:**
```
Subject: YES Bank Stock Alert
Body: YES Bank price is ₹17.50, crossed your threshold ₹18.0.

Alert Details:
- Stock Symbol: YESBANK.NS
- Current Price: ₹17.50
- Threshold: ₹18.0
- Alert Time: 2025-08-29 10:30:15 IST

This alert was triggered during NSE market hours (09:15 AM - 03:30 PM IST).
```

**Improvements:**
- ✅ **Cleaner subject line** (as requested)
- ✅ **IST timestamp** clearly marked
- ✅ **Market hours confirmation** in email body

## 🛡️ **5. Robust Error Handling**

**Enhanced Features:**
- **API Failure Graceful Handling**: Continues running during Yahoo Finance outages
- **Market Hours Awareness**: Different error handling during/outside market hours
- **Connection Retry Logic**: Automatic retries with exponential backoff
- **Detailed Logging**: Market status and data freshness tracking

**Error Scenarios:**
```python
# During market hours - critical errors
if market_open and price_data_failed:
    logger.error("❌ Connection failed during market hours - needs attention")
    
# Outside market hours - expected behavior  
if market_closed and price_data_failed:
    logger.info("🔒 Connection issues outside market hours - normal")
```

## 📁 **6. Updated Files**

### **config.py** - Enhanced Configuration
```python
# New market hours configuration
MARKET_TIMEZONE = pytz.timezone('Asia/Kolkata')
MARKET_OPEN_TIME = time(9, 15)   # 09:15 AM IST
MARKET_CLOSE_TIME = time(15, 30) # 03:30 PM IST
PRICE_THRESHOLD = 18.00  # Updated threshold

# Market hours checking method
@classmethod
def is_market_open(cls):
    # Returns True only during NSE trading hours
```

### **stock_monitor.py** - Enhanced Monitoring
```python
class StockMonitor:
    # Rate limiting state variables
    self.alert_sent = False
    self.last_price_above_threshold = True
    
    # Market-aware price fetching
    def get_current_price(self):
        # Real-time data during market hours
        # Historical data when market closed
    
    # Enhanced alert logic
    def should_send_alert(self, current_price):
        # 1. Market hours check
        # 2. Threshold check  
        # 3. Rate limiting check
```

### **main.py** - Enhanced Application
```python
# Enhanced logging with market status
def start_monitoring(self):
    self.logger.info("Market hours: 09:15 - 15:30 IST")
    self.logger.info("Alert logic: Only during market hours, rate-limited")
    
# Market status in price checks
def run_price_check(self):
    # Shows market open/closed status
    # Logs alert state (READY/SENT)
```

## 🧪 **7. Testing Results**

**Test Script Output:**
```
=== MARKET HOURS DETECTION ===
Market is currently: CLOSED
NSE Trading Hours: 09:15 - 15:30 IST
Current IST time: 2025-08-28 23:13:23 Thursday

=== RATE LIMITING LOGIC ===
Step 1: Price above threshold - ₹19.00
Step 2: Price below threshold (first time) - ₹17.50
  → Would send alert (first time below threshold)
Step 3: Price still below threshold - ₹17.30  
  → Would NOT send alert (already alerted for this period)
Step 4: Price recovered above threshold - ₹18.50
  → Alert state reset (price recovered)
Step 5: Price below threshold again - ₹17.80
  → Would send alert (first time below threshold)

✅ Market hours detection working
✅ Alert logic properly filtered  
✅ Rate limiting logic implemented
✅ Email format updated
```
